## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Alex

Iâ€™m an international student with a **Bachelorâ€™s** and a **Master of Applied Science** degree in **Electrical and Computer Engineering**.

My passion lies in solving real-world problems through a combination of hardware and data-driven solutions. I have a broad range of interests, including:

- **Data Science** â€“ transforming raw data into intelligent, actionable insights  
- **Robotics** â€“ designing and implementing systems that interact with the physical world  
- **Embedded Systems** â€“ developing efficient, low-level software for smart and connected devices

I enjoy working at the intersection of these fields and actively pursue research, collaborative development, and open-source contributions.
